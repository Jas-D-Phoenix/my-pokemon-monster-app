# Welcome to My Pokemon App
***

## Task
I am to Create a multiple page application using ReactJS.
the first page will display all the pokemons, with lazy loading.
 Another page will show the detail of a specific pokemon.
the application will also provide a search bar to filter pokemon.

## Description
I was able to install react, react- router-dom and axios.
 I created components that contained everything you need to search for a pokemon such as
pokemone, pokemondetails, pokemoncard, and a searchBar then deployed it on netlify.
## Installation
You click on this link to access the site https://64e5398f7561923a5bc0649d--cozy-sfogliatella-536b90.netlify.app/

## Usage
You can search for any pokemon and get a card with details of that pokemon.
